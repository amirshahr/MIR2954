# The script takes four input files
# 1) a miRNA file: a tab-delimited text file of mature miRNA information.  This is different from the file required by targetscan_60.pl.
# 2) a UTR file: a tab-delimited multiple sequence alignment of the 3' UTRs of genes from the desired species
#		which is the same as the input file for targetscan_60.pl.
#	3) a PredictedTargets file: output from targetscan_60.pl.
#	4) TA_SPS_by_seed_region.txt: Contains input parameters and must be in same directory as targetscan_60_context_scores.pl.


1. Generate miRNA Input File for TargetScan Context Scores

```{r}
# Clear environment
rm(list = ls())

# Load necessary library
library(tidyverse)

# Define the header
header <- c("miRNA_family_ID", "Species_ID", "MiRBase_ID", "Mature_sequence")

# Define miRNA information for miR-2954
miRNA_info <- c("mir-2954", "9031", "mir-2954", "CAUCCCCAUUCCACUCCUAGCAG")

# File path for the output
file_path <- "/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/miR_for_context_scores.txt"

# Combine header and miRNA information into a single tab-separated string
file_content <- paste(paste(header, collapse = "\t"), paste(miRNA_info, collapse = "\t"), sep = "\n")

# Write the content to the file
writeLines(file_content, con = file_path)

# Confirmation message
cat("File successfully created at:", file_path, "\n")

```



2. Verify Input Files Before Running TargetScan
```{bash}
# Display first few lines of the input files
head /home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/miR_for_context_scores.txt
head /home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/Processed_GRCG7b_3UTR.txt
head /home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/Processed_miR-2954_predicted_targets.txt

```


3. Run TargetScan to Calculate Context Scores
```{r}
# Execute TargetScan context score calculation
/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/targetscan_60_context_scores.pl \
/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/miR_for_context_scores.txt \
/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/Processed_GRCG7b_3UTR.txt \
/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/Processed_miR-2954_predicted_targets.txt \
/home/amir/miR-2954/targetscan_60_context_scores_output.txt

```

4. Load and Process TargetScan Output
```{r}
# Load predicted target genes
targets <- read.delim("/home/amir/miR-2954/mir_2954_target_prediction/Processed_miR-2954_predicted_targets.txt")

# Load context scores
context_scores <- read.delim("/home/amir/miR-2954/targetscan_60_context_scores_output.txt", check.names = TRUE) %>%
  separate(Gene.ID, into = c("Gene.ID", "Transcript.ID"), sep = "\\|", extra = "drop") %>% # Ensure clean separation
  rename(gene_id = Gene.ID, context_score = `context..score`) %>%
  mutate(context_score = as.numeric(context_score))  # Convert context scores to numeric

# Display processed context score data
head(context_scores)

```

5. Summarize Context Scores by Gene
```{r}
# Summarize context scores per gene
summed_scores <- context_scores %>%
  mutate(context_score = ifelse(context_score > 0, 0, context_score)) %>%  # Ensure only negative scores are considered
  group_by(gene_id) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_context_score = sum(context_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    average_context_score = mean(context_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_context_score = median(context_score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Display summary statistics
head(summed_scores)

```
